In the 80s (mostly) everyone had a Home Computer. And at that time it means you have to learn how to code and read some books to use it. At least a little bit of BASIC. It’s without any doubt one of the reasons this time brought up some of the most famous programmers!

Why programming on a Retro Home Computer today?

Because it’s a lot of fun, because you always wanted to write a game, because you want impress yourself or your childrens?

All very valid reasons but there also more serious benefits to learn with a Retro-Computer:

- Understand the basic ideas what a CPU does, many of today’s programmers lack that understanding
- Get the aid of the built-in BASIC interpreter, that shows off what’s possible with the hardware
- Assembly helps you to understand of how memory and memory management, pointer, address, and instructions work at a very low level


[The Classics Coder App](http://www.classicscoder.com/downloads/classics-coder-latest.zip) teaches you exactly that! But also it makes your life as an aspiring Classics Coder much easier than it was in the 80’s. Do everything on your iPad or MacBook in one tool, use a modern editor and visual tools with interactive help to see and learn what the written code does. You prefer the original hardware? No problem, all the tutorials are working identically also on the original hardware.
